# Advanced-Sequence-Analysis
website link: https://mspjpr.github.io/Advanced-Sequence-Analysis/
Objective

The project aims to develop a web-based platform for biological sequence analysis, enabling researchers and students to analyze DNA and protein sequences interactively. It integrates advanced tools for sequence alignment, codon usage analysis, motif searching, and visualization.

Key Features

1. Sequence Alignment:

Implements global alignment (Needleman-Wunsch) and local alignment (Smith-Waterman) algorithms directly in
JavaScript.
2. Codon Usage Bias Analysis:

Compares codon usage in user-provided sequences against standard organisms like E. coli or humans.

3. Motif Search and Highlighting:

Allows users to search for specific motifs or regulatory elements in DNA sequences (e.g., TATA boxes, AT-rich regions).
4. Real-Time Interaction:

Users can upload sequences, set alignment parameters, and interact with the results dynamically.
Technical Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Potential Applications

Bioinformatics research for studying genetic sequences.

Educational tool for teaching sequence alignment and codon analysis.

Real-time motif search for regulatory region analysis in genomes.
